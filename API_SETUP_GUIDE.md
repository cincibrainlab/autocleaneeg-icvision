## ü§î What is an API Key?

Think of an API key like a **password that allows ICVision to talk to OpenAI's servers**.

- **API** = Application Programming Interface (how programs talk to each other)
- **Key** = A secret password that proves you have permission to use OpenAI's services

**Why do you need this?**
- ICVision sends your EEG component images to OpenAI's AI models for classification
- OpenAI needs to know who is making the request (for billing and security)
- The API key is your "digital signature" that identifies your account

## üîê Getting Your OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Create an OpenAI Account

1. **Go to OpenAI's website**: https://platform.openai.com/
2. **Click "Sign up"** (or "Log in" if you already have an account)
3. **Create your account** with email and password
4. **Verify your email** when prompted

### Step 2: Add Payment Information

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: OpenAI requires a payment method even for small usage amounts.

1. **Go to "Billing"** in your OpenAI dashboard
2. **Add a payment method** (credit card)
3. **Set up billing limits** (recommended: start with $5-10/month)

**Cost Estimate**: Processing 100 EEG components typically costs $0.50-$2.00

### Step 3: Generate Your API Key

1. **Navigate to "API Keys"** in the left sidebar
2. **Click "Create new secret key"**
3. **Give it a name** (e.g., "ICVision Research Key")
4. **Copy the key immediately** - you won't be able to see it again!

**Your API key will look like this:**
```
sk-proj-abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456qrst7890uvwx1234yz567890ab
```

## üîß Setting Up Your API Key

You have three options for providing your API key to ICVision. Choose the one that works best for you:

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)

This is the **safest and most convenient** method.

#### On Windows:

**Method A: Using Command Prompt**
1. **Press `Win + R`**, type `cmd`, press Enter
2. **Type this command** (replace `your_actual_key` with your real key):
   ```cmd
   setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-proj-your_actual_key_here"
   ```
3. **Close and reopen** any command prompts or applications
4. **Test it worked**:
   ```cmd
   echo %OPENAI_API_KEY%
   ```

**Method B: Using System Settings (Permanent)**
1. **Press `Win + X`** ‚Üí "System"
2. **Click "Advanced system settings"**
3. **Click "Environment Variables"**
4. **Under "User variables"**, click "New"
5. **Variable name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
6. **Variable value**: `sk-proj-your_actual_key_here`
7. **Click OK** to save
8. **Restart your computer** or application

#### On Mac/Linux:

**Method A: Temporary (for current session only)**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-your_actual_key_here"
```

**Method B: Permanent (recommended)**
1. **Open Terminal**
2. **Edit your shell profile**:
   ```bash
   # For newer Macs (zsh):
   echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-your_actual_key_here"' >> ~/.zshrc

   # For older Macs/Linux (bash):
   echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-your_actual_key_here"' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
3. **Reload your shell**:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
   ```
4. **Test it worked**:
   ```bash
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

### Option 2: .env File (Good for Projects)

This method keeps your API key in a special file that ICVision can read.

1. **Navigate to your project folder** (where you'll run ICVision)
2. **Create a new file** called `.env` (note the dot at the beginning)
3. **Add this line** to the file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your_actual_key_here
   ```
4. **Save the file**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Never share or commit the `.env` file to version control!

### Option 3: Command Line (Quick Testing)

You can provide the API key directly when running ICVision:

```bash
icvision data.set ica.fif --api-key sk-proj-your_actual_key_here
```

**Note**: This method is less secure because the key appears in your command history.

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Check Environment Variable

**Windows:**
```cmd
echo %OPENAI_API_KEY%
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

**Expected Result**: You should see your API key printed out.

### Test 2: Test with ICVision

```bash
# Try running ICVision (it will tell you if the API key is working)
icvision --help
```

### Test 3: Quick API Test

Create a simple test script to verify your API key works:

```python
# test_api.py
import os

# Check if API key is available
api_key = os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')

if api_key:
    print("‚úÖ API key found!")
    print(f"Key starts with: {api_key[:15]}...")

    # Test if we can import OpenAI (optional)
    try:
        import openai
        openai.api_key = api_key
        print("‚úÖ OpenAI library is ready!")
    except ImportError:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è  OpenAI library not installed (this is OK if using ICVision)")
else:
    print("‚ùå No API key found!")
    print("Please set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.")
```

Run it with:
```bash
python test_api.py
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No API key found" error

**Symptoms**: ICVision says it can't find your API key

**Solutions**:
1. **Check spelling**: Make sure it's exactly `OPENAI_API_KEY` (all caps)
2. **Restart applications**: Close and reopen your terminal/command prompt
3. **Check the key**: Verify your API key is correctly set:
   - Windows: `echo %OPENAI_API_KEY%`
   - Mac/Linux: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. **Try the direct method**: Use `--api-key` flag as a test

### Problem: "Invalid API key" error

**Symptoms**: ICVision rejects your API key

**Solutions**:
1. **Check for extra spaces**: Make sure there are no spaces before/after your key
2. **Regenerate key**: Go to OpenAI dashboard and create a new key
3. **Check account status**: Ensure your OpenAI account is active and has billing set up

### Problem: "Rate limit exceeded" error

**Symptoms**: OpenAI says you're making too many requests

**Solutions**:
1. **Wait a few minutes** and try again
2. **Reduce batch size**: Use `--batch-size 5` instead of default 10
3. **Reduce concurrency**: Use `--max-concurrency 2` instead of default 4

### Problem: "Insufficient credits" error

**Symptoms**: OpenAI says you don't have enough credits

**Solutions**:
1. **Check your billing**: Go to OpenAI dashboard ‚Üí Billing
2. **Add credits**: Purchase additional credits or increase your limit
3. **Check usage**: Review your current usage and limits

### Problem: Environment variable not working

**Symptoms**: You set the variable but ICVision still can't find it

**Solutions**:

**Windows**:
1. **Restart your computer** (sometimes required for system-wide variables)
2. **Use PowerShell instead**:
   ```powershell
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-your_key_here"
   ```
3. **Check user vs system variables**: Make sure you set it in the right place

**Mac/Linux**:
1. **Check your shell**: Run `echo $SHELL` to see if you're using bash or zsh
2. **Edit the right file**:
   - Zsh (newer Macs): `~/.zshrc`
   - Bash (older Macs/Linux): `~/.bashrc`
3. **Reload the file**: `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc`

## üîí Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Keep your API key secret** - never share it with others
- **Use environment variables** instead of putting keys in code
- **Set spending limits** in your OpenAI account
- **Monitor your usage** regularly
- **Regenerate keys** if you think they've been compromised

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- **Never put API keys in code** that you'll share or commit to Git
- **Don't share screenshots** that show your full API key
- **Don't email or message** your API key to others
- **Don't use the same key** for multiple unrelated projects

### üõ°Ô∏è Extra Security Tips:
1. **Create separate keys** for different projects
2. **Name your keys descriptively** (e.g., "Lab Computer - EEG Analysis")
3. **Delete unused keys** from your OpenAI dashboard
4. **Use .gitignore** to exclude `.env` files from version control:
   ```gitignore
   # Add to .gitignore file
   .env
   *.env
   ```
