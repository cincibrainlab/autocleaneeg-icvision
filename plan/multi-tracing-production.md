quarto has a callout feature, i want you to strategically implement this
you also have access to my gh cli that is authenticated


Follow thse instructions:
how is the current 9 image strip implemented
use a flow chart to help me understand the code

propose a plan to implement the strip and the current single image side by side
it should be a drop in replacement since this module runs under the larger autocleaneeg-pipeline
in your proposal create a table so i know you have implemented all aspects of single image and have a plan to adapt the strip version so it can be a drop in repolacement (Including outputs etc)

now, i want you to use the callout feature to specifically query me on areas of weakness in the plan or things you need clarification for

please add a gh issue on this feature update
