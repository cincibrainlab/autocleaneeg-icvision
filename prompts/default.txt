Classify this EEG ICA component into ONE category and provide your answer in JSON format:

Categories:
- "brain": Dipolar central/parietal pattern, 1/f spectrum with possible 6-35Hz peaks
- "eye": Frontal/periocular dipolar pattern, low-frequency dominated
- "muscle": Positive spectral slope at high frequencies, edge-focused topography
- "heart": ~1Hz rhythmic deflections in time series
- "line_noise": Sharp peak at 50/60Hz
- "channel_noise": Single isolated focal spot, no dipole
- "other_artifact": Doesn't fit above categories

Respond with JSON: {"label": "category_name", "confidence": 0.0-1.0, "reason": "brief explanation"}
