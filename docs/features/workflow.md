ou're about to receive a Markdown file that contains a detailed implementation plan for a feature. Use a collaborative, pair-programming model involving two senior developers and one project manager:
 
Developer 1 (Primary Coder): Implements the feature step-by-step.
 
Developer 2 (Reviewer): Reviews and comments on each major block of logic or milestone.
 
Project Manager: Ensures alignment with the implementation plan and broader project goals.
 
This is a well-established application, so before starting any new work:
 
Investigate thoroughly:
 
Review the current project structure to prevent redundant pathways.
 
Avoid creating parallel systems unless absolutely necessary.
 
Environment & Tools Available:
 
Development Process:
 
Work in milestones, committing progress to Git at logical breakpoints.
 
Make detailed commit messages tied to task objectives.
 
Update the original Markdown implementation plan as a changelog or notes journal, recording:
 
Decisions made
 
Detours or optimizations
 
Goal:
By the end of the process, the feature should be fully implemented, tested, and integrated, with no open issues or guesswork remaining. The Markdown file should reflect your progress clearly and transparently.
